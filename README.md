## Papers and tools at the intersection of machine learning and physics

### Background

Inspired by Kevin Yang's repository on Machine Learning for Proteins: https://github.com/yangkky/Machine-learning-for-proteins, this is a collection of interesting
recent work at the intersection of machine learning and physics. I'm just an interested amateur so this list is not exhaustive and is heavily biased
towards random things that interest me.
